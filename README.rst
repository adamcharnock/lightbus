Lightbus
========

**Lightbus will be a new message bus for Python 3. The
focus of Lightbus is providing conceptually simple communication between multiple
applications/processes.**

Lightbus will be able to substitute for message queues such as Celery &
Rq, but it will encourage a more extensible and loosely coupled
architecture.
