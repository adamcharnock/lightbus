!!! note "Configuration auto-complete using JSON Schema"
    
    Many code editors support using a JSON schema to provide auto-complete and validation when 
    editing a JSON file. If you wish, you can write your configuration in JSON (rather than YAML),
    and load the following JSON schema into your editor: 
    
        https://lightbus.org/static/default-config-schema.json
    
    This will provide you with autocomplete and validation for Lightbus' various 
    configuration options.
    
    If you are using custom transports or plugins you should 
    [generate your own config schema](command-line-use/dumpconfigschema.md).
