## 2.1 Requirements

Before continuing, ensure you have completed the following steps detailed in
the [installation section](installation.md):

* Installed Python 3.7 or above
* Installed Lightbus
* Running Redis locally on the default port (6379)

Optionally, you can read some additional *explanation* in the
[anatomy lesson] section.

## 2.2 Define your API

First we will define an API for Lightbus to serve.
This will be an authentication API and will live in an 
authentication service.

Create an `auth_service` directory and within there create 
the following in a `bus.py` file:

```python3
# File: auth_service/bus.py
import lightbus

# Create your service's bus client. You can import this elsewere
# in your service's codebase in order to access the bus
bus = lightbus.create()

class AuthApi(lightbus.Api):
    user_registered = lightbus.Event(parameters=('username', 'email'))

    class Meta:
        name = 'auth'

    def check_password(self, username, password):
        return username == 'admin' and password == 'secret'

# Register this API with Lightbus. Lightbus will respond to 
# remote procedure calls for registered APIs, as well as allow you 
# as the developer to fire events on any registered APIs.
bus.client.register_api(AuthApi())
```

You should now be able to startup Lightbus as follows:

```
cd ./auth_service/
lightbus run
```

Lightbus will output some logging data which will include a list of
registered APIs, including your new `auth` API:

![lightbus run output][lightbus-run]

Congratulations, you have now created an authentication service 
which contains a single API named `auth`.

**Leave Lightbus running and open a new terminal window for the next stage.**

## 2.3 Remote procedure calls

With Lightbus still running in another terminal window, 
create a new directory alongside `auth_service` 
called `another_service`. This will be an example service which will 
interact with the auth service. 

You should now have the following structure:

* `./auth_service/bus.py`, created above
* `./another_service/`, which we will create files within now.

We always define a service's `bus` client within a `bus.py` file.
Therefore, create `./another_service/bus.py` containing the following:

```python3
# File: ./another_service/bus.py
import lightbus

bus = lightbus.create()
```

Now create `./another_service/check_password.py`. We will use this 
to experiment with making RPC calls:

```python3
# File: ./another_service/check_password.py

# Import our service's bus client
from .bus import bus

# Call the check_password() procedure on our auth API
valid = bus.auth.check_password(
    username='admin',
    password='secret'
)

# Show the result
if valid:
    print('Password valid!')
else:
    print('Oops, bad username or password')
```

Running this script should show you the following:
    
    cd ./another_service/
    python3 ./check_password.py
    Password valid!

Looking at the other terminal window you have open you should see that
Lightbus has also reported that it is handled a remote procedure call.

## 2.4 Events

Events allow services to broadcast a message to any other services which
care to listen. Your service can fire events on any API which has been registered.

We have already created and registered our `AuthApi` in `./auth_service/bus.py` 
which provides the `user_registered` event.

### Firing events

Let's write a simple script to manually register users and fire events. Note we can only 
fire events for APIs we have registered. We have registered the `auth` API in `auth_service`, 
so it is within this service that this new script must reside. We could not put the script 
within `another_service` as this service does not include the `AuthApi` class and can therefore not 
register it.


```python3
# ./auth_service/manually_register_user.py

# Import the service's bus client from bus.py
from bus import bus

print("New user creation")
new_username = input("Enter a username: ").strip()
new_email = input("Enter the user's email address: ").strip()

# You would normally store the new user in your database
# at this point. We don't show this here for simplicity.

# Let the bus know a user has been registered by firing the event
bus.auth.user_registered.fire(
    username=new_username,
    email=new_email
)

print("Done")
```

Run this script using:

```bash
cd ./auth_service/
python3 manually_register_user.py
```

You should be prompted for a new username & email address, at which point an event will be 
fired onto the bus. We will make use of this event in the next section.

### Listening for events

Perhaps `another_service` needs to be notified when a user is created. To achieve this 
we can setup an event listener by modifying `./another_service/bus.py`:

```python3
# File: ./another_service/bus.py
import lightbus

bus = lightbus.create()

def handle_new_user(event, username, email):
    print(f"A new user was created in the authentication service:")
    print(f"    Username: {username}")
    print(f"    Email: {email}")


@bus.client.on_start()
def bus_start(client):
    bus.auth.user_registered.listen(
        handle_new_user,
        listener_name="print_on_new_registration"
    )
```

Listening for events requires your service to sit waiting for something to 
happen. Sitting around and waiting for something to happen is precisely 
what the `lightbus run` console command is for. 

Therefore, in **one terminal window** startup the `lightbus run` command for 
`another_service`:

```bash
# In the first terminal window:
cd ./another_service/
lightbus run
```

Your service is now waiting for events.

In the **second terminal window** let's cause an event to be fired 
using the script we wrote in the previous section:

```bash
cd ./auth_service/
python3 manually_register_user.py
``` 

You should see that the event gets sent by the `manually_register_user.py` script within the 
`auth_service`, and received by by the `lightbus run` process within the `another_service`.

![Listening for and firing an event][events]

### Listener names

You may have noticed we specified the `listener_name` parameter in the above example, 
and we set it to an arbitrary value of `"print_on_new_registration"`. This is important, because Lightbus tracks 
which listeners have received which events. It is this listener name which is used to 
uniquely identify each listener. You don't need to worry about this often, just follow the rule:

**Ensure you specify a unique `listener_name` every time you setup a new listener**.

The listener name should be unique within the service. Two listeners with the same name 
will only receive a partial set of events each.

## 2.5 Next

This was a simple example to get you started. The [worked example] considers
a more realistic scenario involving multiple services.
